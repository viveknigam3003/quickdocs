## Quickdocs ‚ö°Ô∏èüìÑ

The fastest way to generate good documentation for your JavaScript and Typescript projects. Super simple to use, just run `npx quickdocs` in your project's root directory and you're done! üöÄ

## Features
- Generates documentation for your entire project in seconds
- Supports JavaScript and Typescript
- Minimal configuration required (just a `quickdocs.config.json` file)
- Returns a folder with HTML files which can be hosted on any static file server

The generated documentation is based on the [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org/) project.

## Installation
```bash
npm i -D @viveknigam3003/quickdocs
```

## Usage
Run the following command in your project's root directory. It will generate a `docs` folder with the documentation for your project.
```bash
npx quickdocs
```

## Configuration
Create a `quickdocs.config.json` file in your project's root directory. Configuration options are the same as those for [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org/guides/options/).

Here's an example configuration. You can use the `$schema` property to get intellisense support in your editor, but it's not mandatory.
```json
{
	"$schema": "https://typedoc.org/schema.json",
	"tsconfig": "./tsconfig.json",
	"entryPoints": ["./src/modules/index.ts"],
	"out": "./docs",
	"name": "My project docs",
}
```
